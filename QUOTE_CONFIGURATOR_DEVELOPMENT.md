# Quote Configurator Development Log

## Goal
Convert the existing `quote_popup.liquid` modal into an inline block for the `product.apparel_bundle.json` template, creating a seamless quote configurator that matches competitor functionality with proper pricing and cart integration.

## Requirements
1. **Inline Block**: Available in "Product Information" section of Shopify theme editor
2. **Single Package Pricing**: Quantity = 1 with calculated total price built-in
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Based on print colors, rush processing, and quantity
4. **Custom Cart Integration**: Use existing VastaShop.js pricing system
5. **Competitor UI Match**: Clean, tight layout with proper spacing

## Development Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Basic Conversion ✅
- [x] Created `sections/apparel-bundle.liquid` 
- [x] Created `snippets/quote-configurator-block.liquid`
- [x] Added block schema to `sections/product-template.liquid`
- [x] Added rendering logic to `snippets/product.liquid`

### Phase 2: UI/UX Improvements ✅
- [x] Removed tab navigation, created single-page flow
- [x] Added color swatch selection
- [x] Added front/back design location selectors
- [x] Condensed file upload sections
- [x] Added size breakdown from `product.metafields.custom.size`

### Phase 3: Pricing & Cart Integration ✅
- [x] Implemented dynamic pricing calculation
- [x] Added rush processing option (+$4/unit)
- [x] Integrated with existing VastaShop.js custom pricing system
- [x] Used `bundle: true`, `_perunit`, `_requestPrice` properties

### Phase 4: Final Fixes ✅
- [x] **FIXED**: Quantity now fixed at 1 in cart (prevents user editing)
- [x] **FIXED**: Debug code removed from size breakdown
- [x] **FIXED**: CSS spacing tightened (reduced margins, smaller fonts)
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Front/Back print pricing calculation is correct

### Phase 5: Current Status ✅
- **Cart Integration**: Uses quantity=1 with total price as `_perunit`
- **Pricing**: Correctly calculates based on quantity (e.g., 3 colors × 36 units = $90)
- **UI**: Compact, clean layout matching competitor design
- **Functionality**: All features working as intended

## What Has Worked ✅
1. **VastaShop.js Integration**: Successfully uses existing custom pricing system
2. **Color Swatch Selection**: Works properly with variant resolution
3. **Size Metafield Parsing**: Correctly reads `custom.size` metafield
4. **File Upload**: Handles multiple files with preview
5. **Form Validation**: Proper minimum quantity and field validation

## What Hasn't Worked ❌
1. **BSS App Integration**: Removed - not used in this theme
2. **Direct Price Override**: Shopify doesn't allow variant price modification
3. **Multiple Quantity Variants**: Caused pricing confusion
4. **jQuery Dependencies**: Caused conflicts, switched to vanilla JS

## Current Architecture

### Files Structure
```
/sections/apparel-bundle.liquid          # Main section
/snippets/quote-configurator-block.liquid # Block template
/assets/quote-configurator-block.css     # Styles
/assets/quote-configurator-block.js      # JavaScript logic
/templates/product.apparel_bundle.json   # Product template
```

### Pricing Formula
```javascript
baseTotal = totalQuantity × basePerUnit
frontColorCost = (frontColors > 1) ? (frontColors - 1) × 1.25 × totalQuantity : 0
backColorCost = (backColors > 0) ? backColors × 1.25 × totalQuantity : 0
rushCost = (timeline === 'rush') ? 4.00 × totalQuantity : 0
calculatedTotal = baseTotal + frontColorCost + backColorCost + rushCost
```

### Cart Properties (Updated)
```javascript
{
  'bundle': 'true',
  '_perunit': calculatedTotal,        // Total price (since qty=1)
  '_requestPrice': calculatedTotal,   // Total price for VastaShop.js
  'Front Print': '3 Front Print Colors (+ $90.00)',
  'Size': '12 x XS, 12 x S, 12 x M',
  'Total Quantity': '36 pieces',
  // ... other properties
}
```

## Final Implementation Notes
1. **Quantity Strategy**: Always adds 1 item to cart with total price built into `_perunit`
2. **Pricing Verification**: 3 colors × 36 units = (3-1) × $1.25 × 36 = $90 ✅
3. **User Experience**: Cannot change quantity in cart (prevents pricing issues)
4. **CSS Optimizations**: Reduced font sizes, tighter spacing, removed debug code
