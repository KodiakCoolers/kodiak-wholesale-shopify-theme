# Performance Optimizations Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the performance optimizations implemented for the Kodiak Wholesale Shopify theme based on the GTmetrix report showing ~481 requests and ~10.2 MB on mobile.

## 🔎 Latest GTmetrix Action Plan (Product Page)

Reports reviewed: `tBsMBbTT`, `CYuBpI2u`

- **Total payload (LCP context)**: 8.39 MB (target: < 2.0 MB)
- **JavaScript execution (TBT driver)**: 1.8 s total CPU (target: < 150 ms TBT)
- **Long main-thread tasks**: 20
- **CLS sources**: large offscreen a11y element; late fonts; late third-party CSS/JS

### Top offenders observed
- Images 160–200 KB each loading early (multiple hero/gallery candidates)
- Shopify preview bar vendor JS: 184 KB (preview only)
- Third-party scripts causing CPU: jQuery (349 ms), Shopify modules, Flickity (151 ms), Minmaxify limits, Klaviyo, Dealeasy, Rivo
- CLS from `#aria-screenreader` (1200px font-size box), late font swaps, portable wallets CSS

---

## 🎯 Priority roadmap (plan → implement → test → launch)

### P0 — Reduce LCP payload and block time (highest impact)
1) Images (hero/product gallery)
   - Enforce responsive sizing for all product/gallery images via `srcset`/`sizes` tuned to real viewport breakpoints.
   - Convert where possible to AVIF/WebP; cap initial LCP image to the rendered size (no 2k variants by default).
   - Only first selected image eager with `fetchpriority="high"`; thumbnails and non-selected variants strictly lazy.
   - Verify `width`/`height` present to avoid layout shifts.

2) Preview bar and preview-only assets
   - Ensure preview-bar vendor JS (184 KB) is not present on production; guard with `{% if request.design_mode %}`.

3) Third-party JS CPU/TBT
   - Defer/disable: Minmaxify limits, Dealeasy, Rivo tracking on initial view; load behind a facade on first interaction or after idle.
   - Klaviyo: keep tiny beacon, defer heavy UI bundles until user intent; consolidate duplicate vendor chunks.
   - Flickity: load only on product templates and only when the gallery is within viewport; delay init to idle.

4) Core JS
   - Re-scope `vendors.js`: keep theme-critical libs; split optional libs to a secondary chunk loaded conditionally.
   - Minify `custom-new.js` and split non-critical features behind idle/visibility.
   - Replace immediate DOM scans/loops with chunked work (`requestIdleCallback`/`scheduler.postTask`).

### P1 — Fix CLS and long tasks
5) CLS fixes
   - Replace current `#aria-screenreader` styling with a proper visually-hidden utility (no layout footprint).
   - Add `font-display: swap` (already) and preload only the exact Nunito weights in use; subset if possible.
   - Ensure dynamic blocks (announcements/badges) reserve space with fixed heights/aspect ratios.

6) Long tasks hygiene
   - Break up initialization blocks >50 ms; gate optional widgets behind user intent; remove `InstantClick` if gains are marginal.
   - Confirm jQuery-plugins initialize only when their target exists and is visible.

### P2 — Network and loading order
7) Resource hints
   - `preconnect`/`dns-prefetch`: Shopify CDN, Google Ajax, Klaviyo, unpkg (Flickity), only where still used.
   - Audit duplicate loads of app/vendor bundles; remove preview-only assets from live theme.

8) Caching
   - Verify service worker/static caching strategy for repeat visits; ensure it does not delay first paint.

---

## ✅ Execution checklist (what we will do next)

- [ ] Guard preview bar assets with `{% if request.design_mode %}` so they never ship on live.
- [ ] Product media: tighten `srcset`/`sizes` and cap widths; add AVIF where safe; confirm only first image is eager.
- [ ] Delay Flickity load/init until gallery visibility; ensure not loaded sitewide.
- [ ] Introduce a lightweight `sr-only` CSS utility and apply to `#aria-screenreader` to eliminate CLS.
- [ ] Facade loaders for Dealeasy, Rivo, Klaviyo UI bundles; keep beacons minimal; shift heavy JS to idle/interaction.
- [ ] Rework `vendors.js` into core + optional chunk; remove unused libs; minify.
- [ ] Minify/split `custom-new.js`; move optional features behind idle/visibility.
- [ ] Remove/disable `InstantClick` if it contributes >150 ms long task without measurable nav gains.
- [ ] Add/verify preconnect hints: Shopify CDN, Google Ajax, Klaviyo, unpkg.
- [ ] Re-run GTmetrix (mobile + desktop) and iterate on any remaining long tasks >150 ms.

### Success criteria for this pass
- LCP payload (initial) ≤ 2.0 MB
- TBT < 300 ms on desktop, trending toward < 150 ms
- CLS < 0.02 from a11y and fonts
- No more than 1 carousel-related long task > 100 ms

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Lazy Loading System Architecture
The implementation uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Native lazy loading**: `loading="lazy"` for browsers that support it
2. **LazySizes library**: Existing polyfill for older browsers
3. **Custom IntersectionObserver**: Enhanced lazy loading for complex elements
4. **Third-party script delay**: User interaction-based loading

### Font Loading Strategy
- **Critical fonts**: Preloaded and inlined with `font-display: swap`
- **Non-critical fonts**: Loaded asynchronously
- **Fallback fonts**: System fonts ensure immediate text rendering

### Image Optimization Hierarchy
1. **AVIF**: Modern format for maximum compression
2. **WebP**: Widely supported modern format
3. **Original**: Fallback for all browsers
4. **Lazy loading**: Prevents unnecessary downloads
5. **Responsive images**: Right size for each device

## 📊 Expected Performance Impact

Based on the optimizations implemented:

### Request Count Reduction
- **Third-party scripts delayed**: ~15-20 fewer initial requests
- **Lazy-loaded images**: ~30-50 fewer initial requests  
- **Deferred JavaScript**: ~5-8 fewer blocking requests
- **Product page menu**: ~10-15 fewer DOM elements

**Expected**: 481 → ~150-200 requests on first view

### Page Weight Reduction
- **Modern image formats**: 30-50% reduction in image payload
- **Lazy loading**: 60-70% fewer images loaded initially
- **Deferred resources**: ~500KB-1MB fewer initial downloads

**Expected**: 10.2MB → ~2-3MB initial page weight

### Core Web Vitals Improvement
- **LCP**: 1.7s → ~1.1-1.3s (preload + fetchpriority)
- **TBT**: 1.7s → <300ms (script deferral + splitting)
- **TTI**: 13.4s → <4s (comprehensive script optimization)
- **FCP**: Should improve to <0.9s (critical CSS + font optimization)

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Testing Checklist
1. **Verify LCP image loads properly** on product pages
2. **Test third-party script functionality** after user interaction
3. **Confirm modern image format fallbacks** work correctly
4. **Validate lazy loading** doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Check product page menu** loads full menu on click

### Monitoring
- **GTmetrix**: Re-test to measure request count and page weight reduction
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, TBT, and TTI improvements
- **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience improvements

### Rollback Plan
All changes are incremental and can be reverted by:
1. Removing `type="lazyload2"` attributes from scripts
2. Reverting image-element.liquid to original version
3. Removing conditional menu logic from header.liquid
